### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.10 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-recognition.git
cd mnist-digit-recognition

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

## 📸 Visualizations

All visualizations are automatically generated and saved in the `results/` folder:

1. **Sample Digits**: Shows 15 random handwritten digits from the training set
2. **Training Comparison**: Plots accuracy and loss curves for both models
3. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes prediction performance across all digit classes
4. **Misclassified Examples**: Shows the first 20 incorrect predictions with confidence scores
5. **Correct Predictions**: Displays correctly classified samples with confidence scores

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **CNN Superiority**: Convolutional layers automatically learn spatial hierarchies in images, making them more effective than fully connected networks for image classification tasks.

2. **Feature Learning**: CNNs learn hierarchical features (edges → shapes → digits) which provides better representation compared to flattened pixel inputs used by simple neural networks.

3. **Error Analysis**: Most errors occurred with digits that share visual similarities:
   - Digit 5 had the lowest recall (97.98%), often confused with 3 and 8
   - Digit 7 had lower precision (97.98%), sometimes predicted as 1 or 9
   - Digits 4 and 9 showed confusion due to similar curved tops

4. **Generalization**: CNN showed significantly better generalization with lower validation loss, indicating reduced overfitting through architectural inductive biases.

5. **Robustness**: High precision and recall across all classes (>97.9%) demonstrates model robustness to variations in handwriting styles.
